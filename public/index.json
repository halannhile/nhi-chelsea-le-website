It is in fact a sub-category of the AI universe. In simple terms, ML is defined as the process of providing the computer (i.e. the machine) with data for it to learn from, so that when presented with new and unseen data in the future, it can correctly predict a desirable response.\nNotice the word ‘predict’ in bold here. Any ML task can be simply interpreted as a prediction problem.\nE.g. 1. Given all the monthly sales metrics for a particular chips brand over the past 3 years, what is the predicted number of sales for next month?\nE.g.2. Given a handwritten number, what digit is it (from 0 to 9)?\nE.g.3. When an email appears in your inbox, should it be classified as spam, given information such as the addresses you have blocked, advertisement words like promotion or discount, etc.?\nIn statistical terms, ML describes the process below:\nGiven the input information X (also called predictors, (independent) variables, features) and output information Y (also called response or dependent variable), what is the function f that can help us arrive at Y from X, allowing for some random error?\n\\[Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\]\n\rX variables can be either quantitative or categorical, or a combination of both.\n\rY can be either quantitative or categorical but not both.\n\r\\(\\epsilon\\) is the random, irreducible error that we cannot control nor reduce.\n\r\rThe goal of ML is to estimate unknown function f that can help make use of the predictors X’s and produce future predictions about the response Y that we are interested in.\nHowever, it is worth noting that no matter how well we try to model this function, it will always contain some error specified by \\(\\epsilon\\) as defined above. So, what is the point of ML then, given that we can never get to the truth?\nConsider the case where \\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\) is the predicted value of unknown response Y using the known predictors X and our estimated function f. Let’s also assume that \\(f(X)\\) and \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) are known. It follows that (see full derivation at the end of this post):\n\\[E(Y - \\hat{Y}) = E[f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 = [f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\\epsilon) \\space \\space \\space \\space \\space \\space \\space \\space (1)\\]\r\\[= Reducible \\space Error + Irreducible \\space Error\\]\rWhere:\n\rReducible error is the squared difference between the actual value of Y, given by \\(f(X)\\) and the predicted value of Y, given by \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\).\n\rIrreducible error is the variance of the error term, \\(Var(\\epsilon)\\).\n\r\rHence, ML aims to estimate function f such that the reducible error is minimised.\n\rParametric and Non-parametric Modeling:\rTo model the function f, we have two options:\nParametric methods:\r\r\rMake assumptions about the form of f (such as: linear, quadratic, piecewise polynomial, etc.).\n\rAdvantage: reduces the problem down to estimating a set of parameters.\n\rDisadvantage: the assumed form of function might be incorrect, resulting in poor performance. This is the problem of high bias (to be discussed shortly).\n\r\rImage credit: ISLR, page 22\nNon-parametric methods:\r\r\rMake NO assumptions about the form of f. Instead, they try to find f that is as close to the data as possible but not perfectly close to avoid overfitting.\n\rAdvantage: highly flexible and can fit a wide range of shapes.\n\rDisadvantage: Unlike parametric methods where the problem is reduced down to estimating only a set of parameters, non-parametric methods require a lot of data to accurately estimate an arbitrary f. Moreover, they are also more easily prone to high variance or overfitting (to be discussed shortly).\n\r\rImage credit: ISLR, page 24\n\rI. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:\rFull derivation of (1):\n\\[E(Y - \\hat{Y}) = E[f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X)]^2\\]\nWhere \\(f(X)\\) and \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) are known and \\(\\epsilon\\) is unknown.\rWe have that \\(E(c) = c\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant (i.e. is known).\n\\[E(Y - \\hat{Y}) = E[f(X) + \\epsilon - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 = E[(f(X)-\\hat{f}(X)) + \\epsilon]^2\\]\r\\[= E[f(X)-\\hat{f}(X)]^2 + 2.E[f(X)-\\hat{f}(X)].E(\\epsilon) + E(\\epsilon^2)\\]\rWe also made the assumption that \\(\\epsilon\\) is random, which is equivalent to \\(\\epsilon\\) ~ \\(WN(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)\\). Hence \\(E(\\epsilon)=0\\).\n\\[=E[f(X)-\\hat{f}(X)]^2 + E(\\epsilon^2)\\]\rWe have: $Var() = E(^2) - [E()]^2 = E(^2) $ because \\(E(\\epsilon) = 0\\). And because \\(f(X)\\) and \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) are known constants:\n\\[= [f(X) - \\hat{f}(X)]^2 + Var(\\epsilon)\\]\n\r","date":1595462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595496267,"objectID":"f28b42c4feb991d60fe8eb9f3536779e","permalink":"/post/machine-learning-crash-course-p-1-introduction-to-statistical-learning/","publishdate":"2020-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/machine-learning-crash-course-p-1-introduction-to-statistical-learning/","section":"post","summary":"What is machine learning?

This also gives members an insight into what it is like to work as an actuary at the respective firms.\nEpisode 1: Deloitte with Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill:\nFor this episode, we had the wonderful opportunity to interview Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill, Graduates and Actuarial Analysts at Deloitte. Together, we were engaged in a very informative, thought-provoking but all the while, interesting conversation about university experiences, internship and graduate applications, the actuarial industry and work of an actuary.\nEpisode 2: KPMG with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau\nIn the second episode of our podcast series, “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we sat down with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau who are Actuarial Consultants at KPMG Australia. Together, we touched on multiple facets of their professional career, ranging from their experiences at university, internship and graduate applications to the actuarial industry and the work of an actuarial consultant at KPMG.\nEpisode 3: UniSuper with Young Tan and Vivian Dang\nIn our third episode of our “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we dived into the world of superannuation with Young Tan and Vivian Dang from UniSuper. With a more industry focussed episode, we discussed the projects and unique challenges of working in the superannuation industry and the role of an actuary in this field.\nIt was such a rewarding feeling to receive positive feedback from the students, sponsors and academic staff about our podcast series.
