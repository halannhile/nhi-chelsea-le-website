In this series, I will attempt to explain fundamental concepts in machine learning to you in understandable terms that are also not oversimplified.\nI am definitely not an expert in the field, just a student who has really enjoyed learning about this area. My coding journey started quite late, only a bit more than half a year ago, when I entered the second semester of my first year at university. So if you are also just starting out, believe that you can and will get better at it, so long as the passion is there.\nThe first post is simply just an overview of what I will be covering throughout the whole crash course.

This also gives members an insight into what it is like to work as an actuary at the respective firms.\nEpisode 1: Deloitte with Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill:\nFor this episode, we had the wonderful opportunity to interview Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill, Graduates and Actuarial Analysts at Deloitte. Together, we were engaged in a very informative, thought-provoking but all the while, interesting conversation about university experiences, internship and graduate applications, the actuarial industry and work of an actuary.\nEpisode 2: KPMG with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau\nIn the second episode of our podcast series, “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we sat down with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau who are Actuarial Consultants at KPMG Australia. Together, we touched on multiple facets of their professional career, ranging from their experiences at university, internship and graduate applications to the actuarial industry and the work of an actuarial consultant at KPMG.\nEpisode 3: UniSuper with Young Tan and Vivian Dang\nIn our third episode of our “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we dived into the world of superannuation with Young Tan and Vivian Dang from UniSuper. With a more industry focussed episode, we discussed the projects and unique challenges of working in the superannuation industry and the role of an actuary in this field.\nIt was such a rewarding feeling to receive positive feedback from the students, sponsors and academic staff about our podcast series.

Therefore, it was undoubtedly challenging for us to continue serving the international students cohort at Monash with such a low budget.\nAs the Treasurer for MUISS, I saw it as my responsibility to make sure that we become more financially independent, not only in 2020 but also in the years to come. Using the experience I have gained working with sponsors over at the Monash Actuarial Students Society (MASS), I initiated a sponsorship project to find external organisations that would be interested in a sponsorship agreement with MUISS.\nThe outcome of the project is still to be finalised, but I have started to receive expressions of interest from some of the organisations that I contacted.

Ever since I started my first year at Monash, I have always had an immense passion for data analytics, and so naturally, being able to work at Quantium some day has been my biggest dream.\nThis experience, therefore, was so rewarding and eye-opening for me. Not only was I among the first few people to experience the program prior to its launch day, I was also given the opportunity to provide suggestions on where and how the internship can be further improved. Many of my recommendations ended up being implemented by the InsideSherpa and Quantium teams, which is probably one of the proudest moments of my university years so far.\nThe program gave me invaluable insights on the type of work that an analyst does at Quantium. In particular, I was able to learn so much from how they tackle big and untidy datasets to produce commercial recommendations to the client. I hope to continue sharpening my data analytics and coding skills to hopefully, someday, be able to work at Quantium.\nThe materials (slides, videos) attached to this post are my attempts at the internship only.
