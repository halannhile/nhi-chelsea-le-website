      <title>MASS Day in the Life of an Actuary Podcast Series</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With everything moving online due to the impact of COVID-19, the Monash Actuarial Students Society (MASS) team decided to come up with brand new initiatives, one of which is the Day in the Life of an Actuary podcast series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.monashactuary.com.au/podcasts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“Day in the Life of an Actuary”&lt;/a&gt; is a series whereby MASS interview representatives from sponsor firms to discuss the many topics that are of greatest interest to our actuarial student members. This also gives members an insight into what it is like to work as an actuary at the respective firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1: Deloitte with Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this episode, we had the wonderful opportunity to interview Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill, Graduates and Actuarial Analysts at Deloitte. Together, we were engaged in a very informative, thought-provoking but all the while, interesting conversation about university experiences, internship and graduate applications, the actuarial industry and work of an actuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 2: KPMG with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the second episode of our podcast series, “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we sat down with Jordan Forrest and Clemence Lau who are Actuarial Consultants at KPMG Australia. Together, we touched on multiple facets of their professional career, ranging from their experiences at university, internship and graduate applications to the actuarial industry and the work of an actuarial consultant at KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 3: UniSuper with Young Tan and Vivian Dang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In our third episode of our “Day in the Life of an Actuary”, we dived into the world of superannuation with Young Tan and Vivian Dang from UniSuper. With a more industry focussed episode, we discussed the projects and unique challenges of working in the superannuation industry and the role of an actuary in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It was such a rewarding feeling to receive positive feedback from the students, sponsors and academic staff about our podcast series. This project proved to me that while we cannot control the current situation, we can choose to take initiative and make the best out of the matter at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUISS Sponsorship Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the impact of COVID-19, Monash University announced several significant cuts in its financial expenses, one of which is funding for clubs and societies on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Monash University International Students&amp;rsquo; Society (MUISS) has long been fully dependent on the university&amp;rsquo;s central fund for all our activities throughout the year. Therefore, it was undoubtedly challenging for us to continue serving the international students cohort at Monash with such a low budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As the Treasurer for MUISS, I saw it as my responsibility to make sure that we become more financially independent, not only in 2020 but also in the years to come. Using the experience I have gained working with sponsors over at the Monash Actuarial Students Society (MASS), I initiated a sponsorship project to find external organisations that would be interested in a sponsorship agreement with MUISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the project is still to be finalised, but I have started to receive expressions of interest from some of the organisations that I contacted. It would be so rewarding to leave MUISS at the end of this year with some kind of legacy for future committees.&lt;/p&gt;
