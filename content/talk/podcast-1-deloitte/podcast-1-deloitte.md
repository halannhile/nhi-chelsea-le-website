abstract: Last week, the Monash Actuarial Students Society launched the very first episode of our podcast series - Day in the Life of an Actuary - where we sit down with representatives from our sponsor firms and talk about the many topics that are of greatest interest to our actuarial student members. For this episode, we had the wonderful opportunity to interview Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill, Graduates and Actuarial Analysts at Deloitte. Together, we were engaged in a very informative, thought-provoking but all the while, interesting conversation about university experiences, internship and graduate applications, the actuarial industry and work of an actuary. Thank you especially to Jessica Tran and Jasleen Gill, as well as to all the people who have been supporting us in remaining resilient and delivering for our student members during this time.
