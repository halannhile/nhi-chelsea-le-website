With the impact of COVID-19, Monash University announced several significant cuts in its financial expenses, one of which is funding for clubs and societies on campus. 

<br> 

Monash University International Students' Society (MUISS) has long been fully dependent on the university's central fund for all our activities throughout the year. Therefore, it was undoubtedly challenging for us to continue serving the international students cohort at Monash with such a low budget. 

<br> 

As the Treasurer for MUISS, I saw it as my responsibility to make sure that we become more financially independent, not only in 2020 but also in the years to come. Using the experience I have gained working with sponsors over at the Monash Actuarial Students Society (MASS), I initiated a sponsorship project to find external organisations that would be interested in a sponsorship agreement with MUISS. 

<br> 

The outcome of the project is still to be finalised, but I have started to receive expressions of interest from some of the organisations that I contacted. It would be so rewarding to leave MUISS at the end of this year with some kind of legacy for future committees.
