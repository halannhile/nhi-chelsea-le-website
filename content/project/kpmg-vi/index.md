The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship Program offered by InsideSherpa has 3 modules: 

<br> 

1. Data quality assessment: involves assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis.

<br> 

2. Data insights: involves identifying high-values customers based on customers demographics and attributes. I used R for this task. 

<br> 

3. Data insights and presentation: producing data visualisations to present key insights and recommendations to the client. I used Tableau for this task.
